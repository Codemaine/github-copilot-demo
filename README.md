# GitHub Copilot Demo

This is a demo project for the [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/github/copilot) project. The previous sentence was written by it!

This is a (fairly ugly) timer app that was written almost entirely with GitHub Copilot! The React, SVG, and CSS was all done by the AI, with a guiding human hand.

You can see some of the other functions it output [here](https://gist.github.com/cassidoo/6101ef0657665683b787aab5ae9465f4).
